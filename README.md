=

This is OnlineCitys attempt at writing a QR-Code reader for J2ME devices.
We have been greatly inspired by the zxing project, which the code may reflect.

Dependencies:
----
To build the QR-Code reader you will need the following software.
 - [J2ME WTK (MIDP 2.0/CLDC-1.1)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javame/javamobile/download/overview/index.html)
 - [ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/)
 - [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
 - [Antenna](http://antenna.sourceforge.net/)


Howto build:
----
Enter the source folder, correct the filepaths in build.properties, and then:
```sh
ant all
```
